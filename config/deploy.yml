# This is a recipe how to deploy this application to our production environment
#
# You can run the deployment process by typing
#  $ ./scripts/deploy production
#
# or just
#  $ ./scripts/deploy
#

production:
  url: "http://catalog.atk14.net/"
  server: "kajka"                                                              # we are deploying on this server
  user: "devel"                                                                # we are deploying as this user
  directory: "/home/devel/apps/catalog.atk14.net/production/"                  # in this directory is this application installed on the server
  deploy_via: "git_push"                                                       # at the moment this is the only way how to deploy
  deploy_repository: "devel@kajka:apps/catalog.atk14.net/repos/production.git" # this is the URL of deployment git repository with a proper post-receive hook
  deploy_branch: "master"                                                      # the name of the branch in deployment repository

  - "@local composer update"
  - "@local bower update"
  - "@local gulp"
  - "@local gulp admin"
  rsync:
  - "public/dist/"                                                            # since the directory public/dist is ignored in .gitignore we need to synchronize it by deployment process
  - "public/admin/dist/"
  - "vendor/"
  after_deploy:
  - "./scripts/migrate && ./scripts/delete_temporary_files dbmole_cache"

# You can have another stage to deploy application on it (eg. preview).
# In this recipe you can mention only items which differ from the first recipe.

# preview:
#   server: server.example.com
#   user: deploy
#   directory: /home/deploy/previews/skelet.atk14.net/
#   deploy_repository: deploy@server.example.com:repos/atk14skelet.git
